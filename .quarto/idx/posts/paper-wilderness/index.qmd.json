Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 35(9), 750--753.\n:::\n\nIn this research paper, we engage with a debate around the notion of \"wilderness\" \\[ELABORATE HERE\\]\n\nAcross the Amazon, the notion of wilderness continues to be associated with social imaginaries of the region as an empty and pristine *terra nullius*, a framing that has been contested since at least the 1970s.\n\nFrom all the land cover categorized as wilderness in the Amazon (i.e., 223 million hectares), 45% overlaps with Indigenous territories, 42% intersects protected areas and 28% is both unprotected and uninhabited by Indigenous communities\n\nIndigenous territories represent \\~45% of land categorized as wilderness in the Amazon, but account for \\<15% of all forest loss on this land.\n\nAt a time when the Amazon faces unprecedented pressures, overcoming polarization and aligning the goals of wilderness defenders and Indigenous peoples is paramount, to avoid environmental degradation.\n\nExplain the figure.\n\n### Methods detail\n\n::: column-margin\n**Data sources:**<br>\n\nVenter, O. et al.

We assembled a layer where\nwilderness lands were classified into four land regimes: (i) Indigenous territory and protected\narea, (ii) Indigenous territory and non-protected area, (iii) non-Indigenous territory and\nprotected area, and (iv) non-Indigenous territory and non-protected area. \n\nWe used Hansen et al. (2013), version 1.6 for global data on tree cover and tree\ncover loss available in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform.\nThe dataset represents both tree cover extent in 2000 and annual changes from 2001\nthrough 2018 based on Landsat images at 30m resolution. In our analysis, pixels with\n80% or more of canopy cover were mapped as forests. Additionally, we only considered as forest,\npatches of tree cover with at least six contiguous pixels (~0.5 ha). Thus, “forests” are\ndefined as lands with a canopy cover greater than 80% and spanning more than 0.5 ha.\n“Forest cover loss” is defined as a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a\nforest to non-forest state, during the period 2001-2018. In this analysis, forest loss\naccounts, not only for deforestation, but also for forest fires, logging, forest plantation\nrotations, and natural disturbances. We calculated forest cover and forest cover loss within wilderness lands by\nland regime.\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":false,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.653","editor":"source","theme":{"light":"simplex"},"code-copy":true,"title-block-banner":false,"title":"Indigenous lands and deforestation map","subtitle":"Research paper: Reframing the Wilderness Concept can Bolster Collaborative Conservation","author":"Sacha Siani","date":"2022-07-06","categories":["Deforestation","Indigenous people","Amazon","QGIS","R","Global Forest Change","Google Earth Engine"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
