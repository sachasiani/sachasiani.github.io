    "text": "Sacha M. O. Siani (he/ele)\nPhD Candidate\nDepartment of Geography\nIndiana University\nHi! I am Sacha Maruã Ortiz Siani (he/ele), an early-career scientist. So far, my research has focused on socio-ecological system analysis, using geoinformation, remote sensing, spatial analysis and policy analysis.\nCurrently I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Geography at Indiana University-Bloomington (IUB). My PhD research will focus on the effects of conservation policies on deforestation and forest degradation, as well as their social and economic impacts, in the Brazilian Amazon. I hold Master’s degree in Remote Sensing from National Institute for Space Research, Brazil (2016) and bachelor’s degree in Environmental and Sanitary Engineering from University of Taubaté (2012).\nProfessor Eduardo S. Brondizio (Department of Anthropology at IUB, USA)\nIn my master’s thesis, titled Socioenvironmental indicators for monitoring the Mananciais do Rio Paraíba do Sul Protected Area with Sustainable Use, I developed a spatially explicit indicator system to support a socioenvironmental diagnosis and monitoring the protected area. The system consists of a set of indicators, based on remote sensing and census data, which aims to identify and locate in space the conditions for water sources protection and sociodemographic differences within the resident population. Based on these indicators, I developed a socioenvironmental diagnostic of the protected area, considering its specificities, and allowing distinction between different social, economic and ecological contexts. The system is currently being used by the environmental agency to support planning and, in the future, the management and systematic monitoring of the protected area. The conceptual framework developed as part of this project has the potential to be used for planning and monitoring protected areas elsewhere. Dr. Silvana Amaral and Dr. Antonio Miguel V. Monteiro, senior researchers at INPE, supervised this research.\nSince completing my master’s degree in August 2016, I joined the project Tropical Deforestation and Economic Development as a research assistant. Broadly speaking, the project aimed at contributing to the understanding of the effects of structural change and urbanization on tropical deforestation. The project was co-led by Dr. Torfinn Harding (Norwegian School of Economics – NHH) and Dr. Liana Anderson (CEMADEN – Brazil).\nOutside of work, I love surfing, brazilian jiu-jitsu and hiking. I am from Ubatuba-SP, a beautiful small town in the coast of Brasil, but I currently live in Bloomington, IN, USA, with my partner and our dog."

    "text": "Published in: \nFernández-Llamazares, Á., Terraube, J., Gavin, M. C., Pyhälä, A., Siani, S. M. O., Cabeza, M., & Brondizio, E. S. (2020). Reframing the Wilderness Concept can Bolster Collaborative Conservation. Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 35(9), 750–753.\nIn this research paper, we engage with a debate around the notion of “wilderness” [ELABORATE HERE]\nAcross the Amazon, the notion of wilderness continues to be associated with social imaginaries of the region as an empty and pristine terra nullius, a framing that has been contested since at least the 1970s.\nFrom all the land cover categorized as wilderness in the Amazon (i.e., 223 million hectares), 45% overlaps with Indigenous territories, 42% intersects protected areas and 28% is both unprotected and uninhabited by Indigenous communities\nIndigenous territories represent ~45% of land categorized as wilderness in the Amazon, but account for <15% of all forest loss on this land.\nAt a time when the Amazon faces unprecedented pressures, overcoming polarization and aligning the goals of wilderness defenders and Indigenous peoples is paramount, to avoid environmental degradation.\nExplain the figure.\n\n\n\n\nData sources:\nVenter, O. et al. (2016). Global terrestrial Human Footprint maps for 1993 and 2009. Scientific Data, 3(1), 160067.\n\nHansen, M. C. et al. (2013). High-Resolution Global Maps of 21st-Century Forest Cover Change. Science, 342(6160), 850–853.\n\nRAISG - Red Amazónica de información Scocioambiental Georreferenciada.\nQGIS was used to overlap areas considered as wilderness with both Indigenous territories and protected areas (RAISG), using Boolean operations. We assembled a layer where wilderness lands were classified into four land regimes: (i) Indigenous territory and protected area, (ii) Indigenous territory and non-protected area, (iii) non-Indigenous territory and protected area, and (iv) non-Indigenous territory and non-protected area.\nWe used Hansen et al. (2013), version 1.6 for global data on tree cover and tree cover loss available in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. The dataset represents both tree cover extent in 2000 and annual changes from 2001 through 2018 based on Landsat images at 30m resolution. In our analysis, pixels with 80% or more of canopy cover were mapped as forests. Additionally, we only considered as forest, patches of tree cover with at least six contiguous pixels (~0.5 ha). Thus, “forests” are defined as lands with a canopy cover greater than 80% and spanning more than 0.5 ha. “Forest cover loss” is defined as a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest state, during the period 2001-2018. In this analysis, forest loss accounts, not only for deforestation, but also for forest fires, logging, forest plantation rotations, and natural disturbances. We calculated forest cover and forest cover loss within wilderness lands by land regime."
