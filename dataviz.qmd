I love working on creating data analysis and visualization, especially geospatial data. Here I am sharing some figures that I am proud of. They were developed for research projects, consultancies, or just fun.

For data vizualization, my favorite tools are R (mainly ggplot2) and QGIS. I also use Google Earth Engine to preprocess all the geospatial data. Sometimes I also use Adobe Illustrator for final edits.
